Spatial Reference ID (SRID)

The Spatial Reference ID in the database is used for conversion 
between the different projections that we encounter data in. The
database is set up to use the "standard" WGS84 longitude-latitude
projection as its base projection.

			<title>Place (Geographic Location)</title>
			
			<para>The place (geographic location) of a data item is the position of the item
				on the earth in a 2D space. In WDB, the geographic location is by default
				specified using longitude and latitude in a WGS84 coordinate system
				(though this can be changed when the database is set up; consult your system
				administrator). The geographic dimension is specified using a geometry
				object and can be either a point or a polygon.</para>
			
			<para>In addition to using geometry objects to retrieve data, the user can also
				use a PlaceName - a pre-specified name that defines a geometry object in the
				database - to specify location. PlaceNames exist within a place namespace that can be defined
				by the WDB administrator. The default namespace of WDB is the PlaceNameSpaceId 0; defined
				in international english.</para>
				
			<para>PlaceNames are essentially a short-hand for the user; each PlaceName uniquely
				identifies one geographical object (referred to as  a Place definition) in the 
				database (note that multiple PlaceNames may identify the same object).</para>
